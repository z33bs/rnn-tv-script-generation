His advice is to match the number of features with the number of characters. In our case we're looking at about 3.5m characters. Karpathy used 100 seq length, but said you could double speed with minimal performance cost by going to 50.\n",

Still, the network was taking a while. I trimmed seq length to 20 and this worked the best.\n",
